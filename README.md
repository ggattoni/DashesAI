# LinesAI
A simple AI that plays a game with vertical lines

I don't even know what the actual name of the game is, it doesn't exists nothing on the Internet.

This is the initial state of the game:

         |     
        | |      
       | | |      
      | | | |        
     | | | | |      
    | | | | | |     

There is only one rule: you can delete one or more lines **in the same row** and **without going over an already deleted line**.
The player who delete the last line loses.
